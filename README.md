## Setup the Project on your local system

- It is really simple to setup the project on your local system. 
- You need to `fork` this repository, then clone that forked repository by `git clone <link of your fork>` in any folder of your system.
- You have cloned this repository successfully. Now, there are few pre-requisite before running the project, these are the following -
   1. Java must be installed correctly on your system.
   2. Any code editor or IDE for opening the project. My preference would IntelliJ Idea as IDE.
- After meeting above requirements you are ready to use the project.
- Open your IDE/editor and then open this project in that. If Project SDK is not configured, you need to setup that manually.
- Now finally, simply run the Pong.java file.
